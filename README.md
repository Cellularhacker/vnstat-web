git clone -b main --single-branch --depth=1 https://github.com/Cellularhacker/vnstat-web.git
```

## Features

* Automatic light/dark theme

    * hourly
    * daily
    * monthly
    * yearly
    * top days
* Supports any network interface monitored by vnstat

## Important note

This is a very new project, and as such, there will probably be many breaking
changes in the near future. Use the latest tag if you want to deploy this
software.

## Usage

vnstat version 2.x must be configured first. To set up the web interface,
simply place the following files in a directory served by your HTTP server:

* `index.html`
* `style.css`
* `main.js`
* `Chart.min.js`
* `data.php`

> **Note:** `data.php` must be run by a PHP interpreter. Simply serving the
> static content will not work.

The `data.php` script will automatically get data from vnstat's JSON output.
Make sure the `vnstat` executable is in the `PATH` of the PHP interpreter. If
you installed vnstat using a package manager, this should be done
automatically.

## Configuration & customization

Currently, no central configuration/customization location is provided. To
customize the page structure, edit the `index.html` and `style.css` files. To
customize the behavior of the graphs and data processing, edit the `main.js`
file, which includes comments to enhance readability.

There shouldn't be much need to edit the `data.php` backend, but that's where
the backend code is located if it needs to be changed.
